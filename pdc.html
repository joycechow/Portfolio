							<h1>14th Participatory Design Conference in Aarhus, Denmark</h1>
							<p>As part of my work at the Interactive Institute Swedish ICT, I will have the honor of running an interactive exhibition workshop at the <a href="http://pdc2016.org">Participatory Design Conference</a> in Aarhus, Denmark on August 17, 2016
							</p>

							<h3>Exploring challenges facing design practitioners</h3>
							<p>The theme of the conference is ”PARTICIPATORY DESIGN IN AN ERA OF PARTICIPATION”. The workshop I will run explores how to use cards to facilitate conversations in multidisciplinary teams. By inviting stakeholders to contribute by co-creating cards, we enable all views to be better heard and incorporated in decision making.</p>

							<h3>My role</h3>
							<p>These methods were developed through our work in a project that explores future ideas for math education in Swedish middle schools. My role in this project was in co-writing the project proposal which was accepted for funding by Vinnova, background research, user observations and interviews of students and teachers, planning design workshops, and concept development. I took a leading role in writing our accepted case study for publication (download available shortly), as well as planning and running the interactive exhibition at the Participatory Design Conference.</p>
