							<h1>About me</h1>

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/mec.jpg" alt="" /></span>

							<p>
							I always begin with the question "why?" as the real problem to be solved is often not the first one that is presented. I have an analytical and structured approach to solving problems, and strive towards practical designs that make sense, always with empathy for the end user. I am skeptical towards tech for its own sake, and want to be a part of helping form tech which improves our lives. 
							</p>
							<p>
							Born and raised in Canada, I worked as a mechanical engineer, and took a year off to travel in Asia, Australia and Europe. My experiences abroad inspired me to pursue my dream of becoming a designer in Sweden. I enjoy learning about other cultures and feel that my multicultural sensitivity is a strength as a designer and citizen. 
							</p>
							<p>
							I have a life-long love of learning, and as an adult have taken up yoga, snowboarding, scuba diving, dancing, hiking, cross country skiing, sailing, cooking, programming, beer brewing, and most recently sewing.
