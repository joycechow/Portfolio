							<h1>Medical workstation redesign</h1>

							<p>Tissues suspected of cancer are removed via surgery and processed in a pathology grossing procedure prior to microscopic preparation. Findings from the pathology technician during this procedure are moving towards complete digitalization - aka DIGITAL PATHOLOGY. The diagnosing physician uses this information to make an appropriate cancer treatment plan. </p>

							<h3>My role</h3>
							<p>Interactive Institute designed and exhibited an experimental prototype called DigiPat which combines augmented reality and digital photographs. My responsibility as lead interaction designer in the next phase of the project was to improve upon this prototype, particularly the workstation's physical ergonomics.</p>

							<p>The results of this project cannot yet be disclosed in whole due to confidentiality.</p>

							<h3>Understanding</h3>
							<p>My first step was to understand the context where pathology takes place, by observing and interviewing a pathology technican in the hospital. I augmented my research by watching pathology procedure videos on YouTube, as well as trying out our prototype to evaluate its weaknesses and strengths. </p>

							<h3>Exploration</h3>
							<p>In order to improve the existing prototype, I wanted to examine how well would this prototype fit into their existing workflow. What are the effects of introducing more technology into this environment? Was augmented reality more of a distraction than a help? What was the desired outcome of moving towards a paper-free workflow from the beginning? By taking photos instead of drawing diagrams as they do today, what new problems do we introduce?</p> 

							<p>I sketched out several variations of concepts using paper and video storyboards.</p>

							<h3>Insights</h3>
							<p>My background in industrial design influences the way that I work - I think it is important  to make and use physical prototypes, even if rough. An insight gained from this play-acting was that the tissues are rather soft and sloppy, unlike the first rounds of user tests with bananas, which are firm and keep their shape. This influenced the design for the next prototype, which focused on functionality for creating and identifying orientation of tissues when later viewed in photographs.</p>
